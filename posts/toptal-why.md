Going through the profiles for [Laravel developers at Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/laravel), the first thing that immediately jumps out to me is that they're veterans of the field. Most of the people have over a decade of experience  at the very minimum or have extensive experience working with large corporations. 
However, here's why I would be a good fit in those profiles as well. 
## Early Start
I started web development when I was 15 and was a remote freelancer for most of my career. That gives me crucial advantage in handling long distance clients as well as key insights into effective time management and the communication skills to simplify technical jargon to the less tech savvy.
## Laravel's age
Laravel as a framework was launched in 2011. It gained mainstream popularity around 2013. Coincidentally, this was also when I started web development and secure freelance clients. So, I have been able to expand my knowledge and work on live projects as Laravel grew, something even seasoned developers have had to do at the same time.
## Diverse Skill Set
I love learning new skills, and it still remains my favorite hobby. Hence now I am a proficient brand/marketing video creator for videos [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ooHhPG0cRY) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlz9mCYcWPk). I also develop feature rich mobile apps using the latest frameworks like [AskMyAdvisor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/askmyadvisor/id1544603196) or a [simple broadband connector tool](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.riju.broadbandconnect) with 20k+ installs.I also manage a lot of DevOps for my clients, making me a one stop solution to everyone's technical needs.
## Production ready apps
I have had a wide variety of clients. From governmental agencies to shipping conglomerates, my gamut as a web developer is evident from the clients I have worked with over the years. I have consistently delivered reliable code that performs well and most importantly, is scalable. I have a great understanding of test driven development and can manage or lead teams well.

In conclusion, the combination of my skills and experience would make me a perfect fit at Toptal.
