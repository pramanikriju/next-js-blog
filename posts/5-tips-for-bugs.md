We have all been there, trying to solve a problem someone has definitely solved and shouldn't even be a bug in the first place. Here are some tips if you're a new developer
## Google it
Yes, as obvious as it seems, google-ing it and ending up on stack overflow is the most common way of solving your issues. If the first search result isn't your answer, try shortening the error message till you find what you're looking for. 
## GitHub Issues
Maybe the bug you faced is a known issue with the tool you are using and is undergoing work to be mitigated. If not, this might be a good time to get your hands dirty with open source ðŸ˜Ž
## Dedicated Forums
Most popular frameworks have their own discussion forums where people tend to help you faster or have framework specific solutions. For example, Laravel has [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/)
## Ask a coworker or a friend in dev
Or your mentor. Or teacher. Or anyone willing to listen. Often at times, even just saying your bug out loud to someone over a water cooler break can give you a fresh perspective needed to solve the issue.
## Post on Stack Overflow
*This should be your last resort*
Be prepared to face ridicule. Be prepared to not get an answer for months. Be prepared for your post to be marked as duplicate. In short, really reconsider the previous options.
